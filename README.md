# Learn
    In this particular project i started to know how to do an Java application with Spring Framework.
    Was my first contact with H2 database. (I started to put postgres hosted at AWS...).
    Also was my second experience with Heroku.
    First glance at project Loombok too.
    I learned how to do unit test in a API.
    I tried to make one hierarchical structure where Student and Teacher is a Person, and Courses has Teacher and a set of Student. But just started for now.
